# TODO

- [ ] **Hidden Board Animation (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`):**
    - [ ] Examine the existing code related to the hidden board (likely involving CSS classes and JavaScript for toggling visibility).
    - [ ] Modify the CSS in `style.css` to create a smoother and more visually appealing animation (e.g., using `transition` properties).
    - [ ] Adjust the JavaScript in `script.js` to control the animation timing and behavior.
    - [ ] Test the animation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

- [ ] **Post Appearance and Functionality (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `b/*.html`):**
    - [ ] Identify the HTML structure used for displaying posts in `index.html` and the files in `b/` directory.
    - [ ] Modify the CSS in `style.css` to improve the visual appearance of posts (e.g., using better typography, spacing, and borders).
    - [ ] Enhance the functionality of posts by adding features like:
        - [ ] Like/Dislike buttons (if not already present).
        - [ ] Comment section (if not already present).
        - [ ] Improved display of post metadata (author, date, time).
    - [ ] Implement these changes in `index.html` and propagate them to all files in `b/` directory.

- [ ] **Edit/Delete Functionality (`index.html`, `script.js`, `auth.js`, `admin.html`, `b/*.html`):**
    - [ ] **Authentication:** Ensure that only authorized users (e.g., the post author or an administrator) can edit or delete posts. Use `auth.js` to handle authentication.
    - [ ] **UI Elements:** Add "Edit" and "Delete" buttons/links to each post.
    - [ ] **Edit Functionality:**
        - [ ] When the "Edit" button is clicked, allow the user to modify the post content.
        - [ ] Implement a mechanism to save the edited content (e.g., using AJAX to send the updated data to a server-side script). Since there's no server-side code provided, I'll simulate this with local storage for demonstration purposes. A real implementation would require a backend.
    - [ ] **Delete Functionality:**
        - [ ] When the "Delete" button is clicked, display a confirmation dialog.
        - [ ] If the user confirms the deletion, remove the post from the display and update the data source (again, simulating with local storage).
    - [ ] **Admin Privileges:** Implement admin functionality in `admin.html` to allow admins to edit/delete any post.
    - [ ] Implement these changes in `index.html` and propagate them to all files in `b/` directory.

- [ ] **Consistency:** Ensure that all changes are applied consistently across all relevant pages (`index.html` and all files in `b/`).

- [ ] **Followup steps:**
    - [ ] Test the changes thoroughly on different browsers and devices.
    - [ ] Ensure that the website remains responsive and user-friendly.
    - [ ] Consider the performance implications of the changes and optimize the code as needed.
    - [ ] Since there is no backend, the edit/delete functionality will be simulated using local storage. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement a server-side component to handle data persistence.
